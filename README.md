# Out of Thyme!

Out of Thyme! was created as a project for the OSU 2019 Summer Hackathon with the theme being "Time".
We wanted to create a web application for cooking that made the actual execution of a recipe easier. To save each user time, the recipe directions would display in an easy-to-manage list, and timers would be set automatically for the user. Although the app is not completely finished, it is presented today as a prototype that represents the core of our main ideas. We hope you enjoy this concept!

## Getting Started

Simply check out the site at https://hackathon-2019-out-of-thyme.firebaseapp.com/ !. Hit `Enter`, select a recipe, and hit `Submit`! From there you can check off each recipe's steps and timers will be set for you automatically. If you'd like a copy of our source files, they're all contained in this repository.

### Prerequisites
To view the project itself:
A web browser that can navigate to https://hackathon-2019-out-of-thyme.firebaseapp.com/ and run HTML, CSS3, JavaScript.

To work with the source files:
Setup git on your local machine and clone this repository.
Firebase was utilized as the database and host, so you would have to set up your own Firebase project and adjust some code for the recipe directions + configuration.


### Installing
