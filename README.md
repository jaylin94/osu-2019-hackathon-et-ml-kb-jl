# Out of Thyme!

Out of Thyme! was created as a project for the OSU 2019 Summer Hackathon with the theme being "Time".
We wanted to create a web application for cooking that made the actual execution of a recipe easier. To save each user time, the recipe directions would display in an easy-to-manage list, and timers would be set automatically for the user. 


## Features

One of the key features of Out of Thyme! is the application's ability to automatically set timers for the user. No more fumbling around with that confusing timer built into your oven or microwave. Just check each step off as you prep and cook, and the timer will be set automatically for you. Feel free to pause, reset, and start the timer again as your cooking situation changes!

Thanks to Google, Out of Thyme! features the Web-Speech-API for each direction, as well a database and site hosted on Firebase. The Web-Speech-API allows for the audio transmission of each step as home-cooks complete each step. (Add more on Firebase)

The styling of Out of Thyme! was designed to be minimalistic, informative, and modern. We wanted you to feel like you were at home, in a clean kitchen, ready-to-cook. The web application features a landing page with animations, fading in and out as the user enters the main site. The navigation bar on top remains fixed with the background as the user scrolls throughout the main page. Users can select the Home link to redirect back to the landing page, or the About link to open a modal with a project description and author bios. All of the features were designed to be simple, functional, and aesthetically clean.


## Getting Started

Simply check out the site at https://hackathon-2019-out-of-thyme.firebaseapp.com/ !. Hit `Enter`, select a recipe, and hit `Submit`! From there you can check off each recipe's steps and timers will be set for you automatically. If you'd like a copy of our source files, they're all contained in this repository.

### Prerequisites
To view the project itself:
A web browser that can navigate to https://hackathon-2019-out-of-thyme.firebaseapp.com/ and run HTML, CSS3, JavaScript.

To work with the source files:
Setup git on your local machine and clone this repository.
Firebase was utilized as the database and host, so you would have to set up your own Firebase project and adjust some code for the recipe directions + configuration.
